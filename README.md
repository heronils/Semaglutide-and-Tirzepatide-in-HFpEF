# Semaglutide and Tirzepatide in HFpEF ‚Äì Supplementary Analysis Code

This repository contains illustrative code related to the study comparing **semaglutide and tirzepatide in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)**, as registered under:

**ClinicalTrials.gov IDs**: [NCT06914102](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06914102), [NCT06914141](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06914141), [NCT06914154](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06914154)

## üß™ About the Analysis

The primary analyses were conducted on the **Aetion Evidence Platform**, a validated system for generating regulatory-grade real-world evidence and trial emulations. This platform has been rigorously benchmarked against FDA Sentinel workflows and validated in the RCT-DUPLICATE initiative.1‚Äì3

The code provided here is **not sufficient to replicate study results**, as it:
- Does **not include source data** (due to privacy restrictions)
- Supplements the Aetion-based analysis by illustrating:
  - Post-processing steps
  - Plotting of outputs
  - Follow-up time summaries
  - Covariate balance visualization
